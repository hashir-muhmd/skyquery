# SkyQuery

A local AI agent that answers plain-English questions about 20.9M US domestic flights (2023–2025) by writing and running SQL.

**Stack:** Ollama (qwen2.5-coder:7b) · DuckDB · Parquet · Python. Free and fully local.

## Progress
- [x] Day 1: Ollama + qwen2.5-coder:7b running on GPU (RTX 5060, ~4.6 GB VRAM)
- [x] Day 1: 36 BTS CSVs converted to one Parquet file (20,928,599 rows, 357 MB, 16 s)
- [x] Day 1: First DuckDB queries matched against SkyMetrics. Found a null-handling bug: SkyMetrics counted cancelled/diverted flights as on-time (79.1% vs correct 77.5%)
- [x] Day 2: Verified answer key (11 questions). Baseline with raw schema only: **2/5 correct (40%)**. Failures were about column meaning and metric definitions, not SQL syntax
- [ ] Agent loop, guardrails, evaluation

## Data
US BTS on-time performance data, 2023–2025, from the [SkyMetrics](https://github.com/hashir-muhmd/skymetrics) project. The data file is not stored in this repo. Run `scripts/convert_to_parquet.py` to build it.
